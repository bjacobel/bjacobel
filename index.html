<p class="post-title">Hi, I'm Brian. I'm a full-stack developer with passions for journalism, security and the Open Web.</h2>
<p>I'm currently working as a software engineer Boston. In my free time, I don't stop writing code: my projects have included an open-source newsroom CMS and a bookmarking tool for animated GIFs. I get excited about quality software that makes an impact, modern web features and standards, and the idea of transforming areas like journalism and government through computer science. Please use this page to check out what I'm working on and to get in touch.</p>
