<p class="post-title">Hi, I'm Brian. I'm a full-stack developer with passions for journalism, security and the Open Web.</h2>
<p>I'm currently working in Boston at Raizlabs, a mobile development company. I write responsive web apps and craft the APIs that power native experiences. In my free time, I don't stop writing code: my projects have included an open-source newsroom CMS and a web app for forgetful food lovers. I get excited about quality software that makes an impact, modern web features and standards, new technologies at every level of the stack, and the idea of transforming areas like journalism and government through computer science. Please use this page to check out what I'm working on and to get in touch.</p>
