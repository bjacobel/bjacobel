    <p class="posttitle">Hi. I'm Brian. I'm a full-stack web developer, photographer and open-source enthusiast.</h2>
    <p>I'm currently working in Boston at Raizlabs, a mobile development company. I write responsive web apps with a focus on mobile and craft the APIs that power native experiences. In my free time I hack on a newsroom CMS, take photos and write web apps for fun and profit.  I get excited about quality software, modern web standards, new technologies at every level of the stack and the idea of transforming areas like journalism and government through computer science. Please use this page to learn about what I'm working on and to get in touch.</p>
