<p class="post-title">Migrating from GitHub Pages, Part 1: Automated Jekyll builds with Travis CI</p>
<div class="post-content">
    <p>This post is the first of two detailing the setup I’ve picked for hosting my Jekyll site. In the second, I’ll dive into Docker, <a href="https://caddyserver.com">Caddy</a> and Let’s Encrypt. First, though, I wanted to share a cool little feature I built into my workflow with Git, Jekyll, and Travis CI.</p>

<p>I’ve hosted this site on GitHub Pages since 2013, even before I was using Jekyll. It’s been a great little setup, especially the ease of being able to <code class="highlighter-rouge">git push</code> to deploy. Lately, though, one thing has been bothering me about my site: as a web developer who would never consider releasing a site without SSL, the lack of it on my own site was a sore spot. <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/156">HTTPS support for GitHub Pages</a> using custom domains is a much-requested feature, but as GitHub hasn’t made any movement on it and the recent launch of <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let’s Encrypt</a> has made SSL much cheaper and easier to deploy, I thought the time had come to migrate off of GitHub Pages and onto my own hosting solution with SSL support.</p>

<p>One thing that was important to me in designing a system for deploying and hosting my site off GitHub Pages was that it not lock me into using Jekyll. I’ve been very interested in both <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> and wanted to leave the door open to moving to a new blogging platform. With that in mind, I set up my hosting platform to pull static HTML from a Git repository, leaving all building with Jekyll to be done on my laptop.</p>

<p>For this setup to work, I’d need to write Markdown on my computer, <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll build</code> it, and commit both the Markdown and HTML to Git. On GitHub Pages, though, I could just write the Markdown and let The Cloud take care of the build process – a step back in simplicity. To get back to write-markdown-and-commit, I introduced a set of custom build commands to Travis CI, a continuous integration service integrated with GitHub.</p>

<p>Every time I push new Markdown content to GitHub, Travis CI checks out my blog’s repository and installs Jekyll. After doing an incremental build (<a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/3116">new in Jekyll 3.0!</a>), Travis adds any new files in <code class="highlighter-rouge">_site</code> to Git and commits them, then automatically pushes the built files back to GitHub. It’s a simple little feature, but it keeps my Jekyll hosting solution at feature parity with GitHub Pages and my site up to date.</p>

<p>You can view the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.travis.yml</code> that makes this feature tick <a href="https://github.com/bjacobel/bjacobel.com/blob/master/.travis.yml">here</a>.</p>
