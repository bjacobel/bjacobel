                <p>My first post-grad job was as a Web Developer at <a href="http://raizlabs.com">Raizlabs</a>, a Boston mobile development firm. As a member of the web development team, I created responsive web applications, scalable backend services, and APIs that drive awesome apps. I worked on a wide variety of projects, including:<br>
  <p>- a Ruby on Rails and AngularJS interactive marketing tool that was seen by over 1,500 medical professionals across the U.S.</p>
  <p>- REST APIs for an innovative new telecommunications app, an amusement park with global reach, and a Fortune 50 retailer</p>
  <p>- a blazing fast data collection backend using Go and MongoDB that scales to 10,000 concurrent users</p>
  <p>- Every single level of the stack, from pixel-perfect design implementation in HTML and Sass to DevOps with Ansible, Docker and Amazon Web Services.

                <p>Over the summer of 2013, I worked at Atlantic Media on the development team behind <a href="http://theatlantic.com">TheAtlantic.com</a> and <a href="http://thewire.com">TheWire.com</a>. Using Django and PHP, I worked with a small, agile team of full-stack developers on projects including an interactive feature seen by 250,000 visitors. I continued to do freelance work for the Atlantic through the following school year.

                <p>Starting in the spring of 2013, I became the web developer for <a href="http://bowdoinorient.com">The Bowdoin Orient</a>, inheriting a large PHP code base that encompassed both the site's front-end and the newsroom CMS for editors. While maintaining that code base, I've been working on a next-generation system built on Django, Amazon Web Services, end-to-end testing and high scalability.
