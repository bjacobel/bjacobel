title: "Vinz: Credentials management for AWS Lambda"

In my last post, I wrote about [the key management system I'd worked out for one of my Twitterbots]({% post_url 2015-12-28-serverless-twitterbots %}#key-management). Today I'm releasing the evolution of that project as [Vinz, a credential management system for AWS Lambda applications](https://github.com/bjacobel/vinz).

Because conventional credential management best practices aren't a good match for Lambda's "serverless" programming model[<sup>1</sup>](#1)

```
$> vinz --encrypt TwitterConsumerKey
vinz: Enter the secret to encrypt as 'TwitterSecretKey'. (typing hidden):
secrets/TwitterConsumerKey encrypted and saved.
```

{% highlight javascript %}

import Vinz from 'vinz';
vinz = new Vinz();
vinz.get('TwitterSecretKey').then((TwitterSecretKey) => {
    console.log(TwitterSecretKey);
});

{% endhighlight %}

Conventional best practices would say to either place a configuration file alongside your application when it's deployed, place your secrets in a purpose-built container like [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) or [Confidant](https://lyft.github.io/confidant/), or use environment variables. The first is impossible as Lambda doesn't grant you access to either a permanent filesystem or to any customization of deploy/bootstrapping steps, and the second somewhat takes away from the idea of using serverless architecture. I've heard a rumor that Lambda may be adding support for the third strategy (environment variables) soon, but until then, give Vinz a shot and let me know how you like it!
