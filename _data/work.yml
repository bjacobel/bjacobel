    Localytics pushed me to be more than just a can-do full-stack developer - to drill deep into an area that I'm interested in, grow those skills and take ownership. While at Localytics, I:<br>
    <p>- helped build the Remarketing feature, which drove over a quarter million dollars in ARR in its first quarter</p>
    <p>- worked on debt reduction across the Localytics stack, including migrating Remarketing's AngularJS code from Coffeescript to ES6 and from the Rails asset pipeline to Webpack</p>
    <p>- built a React app (powered by AWS Lambda) that helps manage and secure access to a massive AWS fleet</p>
    <p>- helped document and package that React work into a toolkit that will be used for future internal tools.</p>

      <p>- a Ruby on Rails and AngularJS interactive marketing tool that was seen by over 1,500 medical professionals across the U.S.</p>
      <p>- REST APIs for an innovative new telecommunications app, an amusement park with global reach, and a Fortune 50 retailer</p>
      <p>- a blazing fast data collection backend using Go and MongoDB that scales to 10,000 concurrent users</p>
      <p>- Every single level of the stack, from pixel-perfect design implementation in HTML and Sass to DevOps with Ansible, Docker and Amazon Web Services.

    Starting in the spring of 2013, I became the web developer for <a href="http://bowdoinorient.com">The Bowdoin Orient</a>, inheriting a large PHP code base that encompassed both the site's front-end and the newsroom CMS for editors.
