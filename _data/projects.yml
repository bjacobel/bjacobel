    <b>Boston Food Inspections</b> (@bosfoodfails) is a Twitter bot that consumes food inspection data published by
    the City of Boston. Every day, new violations of the city's health code are tweeted alongside geographic information,
    statistics on previous violations, and pictures from the Foursquare API. This project runs entirely on AWS Lambda
    and uses KMS and DynamoDB to store credentials and state, meaning it requires no persistent server to run. Read
    more in <a href="/2015/12/28/serverless-twitterbots/">my blog post about this project</a>.

    <b>Piggydash</b> uses an Amazon Dash button as a digital piggybank, transferring money to my savings account at the
    press of a WiFi-enabled button. This project was written in Python and involved reverse-engineering the
    undocumented Simple API.

    <b>Goggles</b> looks for pictures in the Twitter Streaming API and runs them through a feature classification service to
    determine the image's contents. I wrote Goggles to work on my skills in Go.

    Twitter users.</a>

    <b>Bongo</b> is the third version of the Bowdoin Orient's newsroom CMS. The project aims to bring the Orient up to date
    with modern web application practices like unit testing and intelligent asset management. It also incorporates
    many fresh ideas from other digital journalism properties launched in 2013 and 2014, promoting longform and
    interactive content as first-class citizens. This project is under active development.

    <b>Timewarp</b> is a JavaScript web application I built over two days in 2014. The site uses
    <a href="http://archive.org">Archive.org</a> to find a newsreel published on this date in history, with the
    option to select any day of the year. The results are entertaining and often surprising.

    <b>Menuwatch</b> is a Django app building on the Bowdoin dining experience. Users can sign up and search a database of
    foods offered in Bowdoin's dining halls, then add their favorites to a list to recieve alerts the next time
    they're offered. I developed the site over eight months starting in the summer of 2013 and have now launched it
    on campus.

    <b>Serenity</b> is a continuous integration system for the Northern Bites robotics team. The site listens for pull
    requests made to the team's GitHub account, then checks new code out to an EC2 instance and runs unit and
    integration tests on it. A Rails interface lets developers view the status of builds and their reasons for
    breaking.

    <b>Homebase</b> is a system I developed as a part of a small team taking a course in open-source software development.
    Together, we developed software for a local food bank that allows volunteers to track and schedule shifts
    (an operational task previously done entirely on paper). This project has allowed the Midcoast Hunger Prevention
    Program to expand its hours and reach.
