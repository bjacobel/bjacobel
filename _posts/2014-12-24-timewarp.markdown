I just finished a fun little hack  which I'm calling [Timewarp](http://bjacobel.com/timewarp).

Timewarp uses the [archive.org](http://archive.org) API to search a collection of old newsreels produced by Universal Studios between the years 1930 and 1970. The site tries to find you a nwsreel shown on this day in history, but also lets you pick any day of the year too.

It was a lot of fun to make, and I hope you'll check it out. The source is [on GitHub](http://github.com/bjacobel/timewarp) and the live site is [here](http://bjacobel.com/timewarp).
