A couple weeks back I pushed out a new feature to the site: a [live updating activity feed](http://bjacobel.com/activity) which shows what I've been working on recently.

It works by querying the GitHub API for my most recent commits and pushes to public repositiories. When I'm doing a bad job of keeping this blog up to date with what I've been working on (as I have recently), check out [bjacobel.com/activity](http://bjacobel.com/activity) to check in.
