I've just pushed a new version of the site that includes an almost 100% rewrite of the style!

[I originally developed this site with Macaw]({% post_url 2014-04-28-site-redesign %}), which was a really wonderful experience initially but ended up being a complete mess to maintain. Macaw's autogenerated markup and CSS, while a huge evolution from the output of tools like Dreamweaver, was still characterized by unsemantic tags and repetitive, bizzare styles. Macaw also doesn't support [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), which is my preferred way of writing CSS.

In the interest of keeping the site maintainable, I've just rewritten the site's styles to Sass, in addition to cleaning up the markup and removing quite a few UI warts. I'll be rolling out some improvements to navigation on mobile soon, as well.
