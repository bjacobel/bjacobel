At Localytics I started as a generalist, but found a passion for frontend development in JavaScript and grew those skills to take ownership of parts of Localytics' frontend code. While at Localytics, I:

- helped build the Remarketing feature, which drove over a quarter million dollars in ARR in its first quarter
- worked on debt reduction across the Localytics stack, including migrating Remarketing's AngularJS code from Coffeescript to ES6 and from the Rails asset pipeline to Webpack.
- built a React app (powered by AWS Lambda) that helps manage and secure access to a massive AWS fleet.
- helped document and package that React work into a toolkit that will be used for future internal tools.
