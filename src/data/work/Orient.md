Starting in the spring of 2013, I became the web developer for [The Bowdoin Orient](http://bowdoinorient.com), inheriting a large PHP code base that encompassed both the site's front-end and the newsroom CMS for editors. While maintaining that code base, I worked on a next-generation system built on Django, Amazon Web Services, end-to-end testing and high scalability.
