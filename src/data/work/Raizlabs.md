My first post-grad job was as a Web Developer at [Raizlabs](http://raizlabs.com), a Boston mobile development firm. As a member of the web development team, I created responsive web applications, scalable backend services, and APIs that drive awesome apps. I worked on a wide variety of projects, including:

- a Ruby on Rails and AngularJS interactive marketing tool that was seen by over 1,500 medical professionals across the U.S.
- REST APIs for an innovative new telecommunications app, an amusement park with global reach, and a Fortune 50 retailer
- a blazing fast data collection backend using Go and MongoDB that scales to 10,000 concurrent users
- Every single level of the stack, from pixel-perfect design implementation in HTML and Sass to DevOps with Ansible, Docker and Amazon Web Services.
