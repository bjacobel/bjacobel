Over the summer of 2013, I worked at Atlantic Media on the development team behind the web properties of [The Atlantic](http://theatlantic.com) and [The Atlantic Wire](http://thewire.com). Using Django and PHP, I worked with a small, agile team of full-stack developers on projects including an interactive feature seen by 250,000 visitors. I continued to do freelance work for the Atlantic through the following school year.
