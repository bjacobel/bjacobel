As a Senior Developer at [Axios](https://axios.com), I led projects including building a server-rendering infrastructure for a large-scale React site, a high-performance Node/GraphQL server, a monitoring and alerting stack and a scalable CI/CD system. As one of the original members of the frontend team, I helped enshrine the practices of testing, documentation and remote-friendliness in the Axios tech culture.
