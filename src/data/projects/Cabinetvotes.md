[CabinetVotes.org](https://cabinetvotes.org) helps political activists track how members of the Senate voted on each Cabinet member nominated by President Trump. I built CabinetVotes using APIs from [GovTrack](https://govtrack.us) and [ProPublica](https://propublica.org), plus my [Rak](https://github.com/bjacobel/rak) React site framework, which allowed me to quickly launch an MVP without spending time on configuration or infrastructure. As the site attracted attention (135,000 pageviews in its first month, 50,000 on its biggest day) I added advanced features like filtering, search and outreach tools. CabinetVotes has been my most widely viewed project and I'm super proud of it ☺️
