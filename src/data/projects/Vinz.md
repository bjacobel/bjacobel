**Vinz** helps keep credentials safe in AWS Lambda functions you want to commit to a public VCS. It uses AWS KMS to securely encrypt secrets with a local CLI, and provides a promise-based API for decrypting them inside a Lambda function. Check out [my blog post](/2016/07/12/vinz/) announcing the public release of Vinz.
