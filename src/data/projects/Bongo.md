**Bongo** is the third version of the Bowdoin Orient's newsroom CMS. The project aims to bring the Orient up to date
with modern web application practices like unit testing and intelligent asset management. It also incorporates
many fresh ideas from other digital journalism properties launched in 2013 and 2014, promoting longform and
interactive content as first-class citizens. This project is under active development.
