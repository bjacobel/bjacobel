  <p class="abouttext"> I'm currently a junior at Bowdoin College, where I am pursuing a double major in Math and Computer Science. I hold several jobs, including as a computer science teaching assistant, a photographer and editor for the Bowdoin Orient, and a contributor to Bowdoin's Communications Department publications. In my free time I like to code, whether it be as part of the student collaborative robotics team or on one of the several current projects you can find on my Projects page. I'm passionate about web and iOS development, Linux, photos, Bowdoin, computer science and much, much more.</p>
