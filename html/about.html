    <span class="about-text"> I'm a senior at Bowdoin College studying computer science who's passionate about web development, software engineering, open-source and startup culture. If I'm not hacking on a newsroom CMS or testing code for a robotic soccer team, I'm probably taking photos or exploring Maine.
